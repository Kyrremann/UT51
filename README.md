## Diary

### [rev1] - 2020-04-10

About two weeks ago I finally sat down and created the extended UT47.2 board that I wanted to make. It was some work, as
I had messed up the footprint by updating them to a newer version. Also since I had to move all the components for the
micro controller, I had to create most of the traces a new. I've now gotten the product back from production, but
haven't had time to solder it yet.
